// the sole purpose of creating this file is to make your own custom css
//make sure you include it in the app.scss
// body{
     // '!important' overwrites any other styles
//     background: blue !important;
// }

//if you don't wanna use custom css, go to public>css>app.css and ...
//make your changes in the app.css then run development (npm run dev)
//you however can't use sass if you do it that way
